"If you can imagine it, you can build it."

Dreambuilder is my attempt to give the player pretty much everything 
they'll ever want to build with, and all the tools they should ever need 
to actually get the job done. This game was originally based on 
minetest_game, minus a couple of mods that I don't like, with a number 
of minor things changed, and a number of extra mods added on. Since 
then, many things have changed - while much of the base game is still 
the same, some stuff is different, and many more mods have been added. 
Many of the mods contained in this game have been tweaked from their 
default states. Mods are generally kept up-to-date, and from time to 
time, if an interesting feature pops up in minetest_game, I may port 
that over also.

For a good working demo of the game, you can play with it on my Creative 
server or my Survival server. Both servers have a few extra mods 
installed for their specific needs, but should give you a pretty good 
idea nonetheless. Expect a little bit of lag, they are remote severs 
after all.

What's changed?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ 
* Being that this was originally based on what is now considered an old 
  version of minetest_game, it retains the light-colored theme, because I 
  don't like feeling like I live in a cave when I open a formspec.
* The Plantlife Modpack along with More Trees together add a huge amount 
  of variation to your landscape (as a result, they will add mapgen lag). 
  Active spawning of Horsetail ferns is disabled by default, and I've 
  added papyrus growth on dirt/grass with leaves (using a copy of the 
  default growth ABM)
* The standard inventory that comes with minetest_game has been overridden 
  in favor of RealBadAngel's Unified Inventory mod. This mod gives you a 
  much more powerful inventory, with crafting guide, bags, and more, and 
  it also means that if you're playing this game in creative mode, your 
  stacks are NOT infinite (and they shouldn't be).
* The default bones and TNT mods have been removed, with extreme 
  prejudice. They're not exactly useful for building stuff with.
* Stu's split-limb player model replaces the default one.
* The default hotbar HUD holds 16 items instead of 8, taken from the top 
  two rows of your inventory. The first 10 slots can be accessed by number 
  keys 1-9 and 0, the rest via your mouse wheel. You can use /hotbar ## to 
  change the number of slots from 1 to 23.
* The default lavacooling code has been supplanted by better, safer code 
  from my Gloopblocks mod. That mod also provides stone/cobble --> mossy 
  stone/cobble transformation in the presence of water.
* Paramat's Snowdrift mod is included to give the world some weather! Rain 
  and snow will fall, and snow will accumulate on suitable surfaces. The 
  snow and rain paramaters have been tweaked a bit to my taste. Rain has 
  been made to fall faster, and a new raindrop image has been added that 
  looks better imho. :-)
* An extensive selection of administration tools for single-player and 
  server use are included, such as areas, maptools, worldedit, xban, and 
  more.
* A few textures here and there are different.
* The mapgen won't spawn apples on default trees, only on the apple trees 
  supplied by the moretrees mod.
* A whole boatload of other mods have been added, which is where most of 
  the content actually comes from.
